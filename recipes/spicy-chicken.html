    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp curry paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mango chutney</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 serving salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>50 ml olive oi</li>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>300 g couscous</li>
        <li>350 ml vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make a marinade for your chicken, add the curry paste, chutney, turmeric, salt and olive oil to a bowl and mix it well.</li>
        <li>Cut each chicken breast in half before adding to the marinade. Stir well until all of the chicken is covered.</li>
        <li>Leave the chicken aside for at least 20 minutes â€” ideally in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill pan over medium heat and lay out your chicken pieces. Grill the chicken pieces for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the couscous in a big bowl and carefully pour in the boiling vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave to the couscous to soak for around 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fluff your couscous with a fork and add any extras you want. Pomegranate seeds are great for a colour and flavour.</li>
        <li>Divide your couscous into 4 containers before topping with two pieces of marinated chicken. Finish the dish with a sprinkle of coriander.</li>
